# Spidy-data-crawler
Data crawler to extract data
# Description
Our solution is to develop a web application that crawls for a given set of keywords to extract URLs of the websites that promotes pornography, child abuse, women abuse and cyber bullying.

This crawler is not only limited for those areas but also it can be used to collect data about several illegal websites that promotes drugs, terrorism, ammunition etc
# Working 
<li>
<ul>1. The keywords will be given to the Data Crawler through a Web based Application by the operator.</ul>
<ul>2. Data Crawler performs the obfuscation process and enables the Tor proxies.</ul>
<ul>3. After the above process is initiated , the crawler will query multiple search engines for the given keywords</ul>
<ul>4. The response provided by the search engines is then parsed using a HTML parser and the respective URLs are obtained.</ul>
<ul>5. The URLs obtained from the previous step will then be stored into a cloud database for the purpose of data integrity and remote access.</ul>
<ul>6. The data that is stored in the database will then be presented to the operator through the web application.</ul></li>
